## Unique Features : What Makes My APP Different and Unique From Others

- **Text-to-Speech for mute users**:

  - A typed message is converted into a voice message for the receiver (via Murf TextToSpeech).
  - Hence,Making it useful for Mute People to send what they want to speak through text,but message will be delivered to receiver as if the sender is speaking.

- **Security check for rooms**: Prevents ghost rooms by verifying peer existence before creation.

- **Summarize and send**:

  - Upload a PDF, generate a summary, and send the summary instead of the full file (ideal for sharing articles,notes).
  - Used Gemini AI to generate summary of not more than 300 words.

- **Self-chat**: Personal room for storing notes and messages to self.

- **Auto-translate with Gemini AI**:

  - Messages are automatically translated into the receiverâ€™s preferred language.
  - Receiver always hears messages in their own language.
  - Example: User can send text in any language (ex.TELUGU, not supported by Murf AI)->used Gemini AI to detect the sender language and to Translate it into Receiver's Language.Hence receiver can receive and listen messages in his preferred language(Which is Set at the time of signup).

- **Ensuring Message Delivery**: If Gemini AI translation fails, the original message is still delivered ,but in sender's language.

- **Multi-modal chat**: Every message exists as both text and audio.
